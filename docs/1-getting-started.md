# Getting Started with Alonzo
  		  
This guide gives you can an overview to this repository, as well as how we can apply the process of "chat-ops" to the classroom.

## Background
Alonzo is a bot which connects to a chatroom. The bot receives all the comments from users in the chatroom, and has the ability to respond to them. Alonzo is an instance of Github's [Hubot][hubot] framework. 

## Next Steps

* If you just want to write some fun/useful/whatever scripts check out the development.md doc in this repo.
* If you don't care about writing scripts but need Alonzo to work for the next semester check out the course-setup.md doc in this repo.
* Otherwise feel free to browse the scripts here!
